#' Convert a neighbor list into a sfnetwork
#'
#' Neighbor lists are sparse adjacency matrices in list format that specify for
#' each node to which other nodes it is adjacent.
#'
#' @param neighbors A list with one element per node, holding the indices of
#' the nodes it is adjacent to.
#'
#' @param nodes The nodes themselves as an object of class \code{\link[sf]{sf}}
#' or \code{\link[sf]{sfc}} with \code{POINT} geometries.
#'
#' @param directed Should the constructed network be directed? Defaults to
#' \code{TRUE}.
#'
#' @param edges_as_lines Should the created edges be spatially explicit, i.e.
#' have \code{LINESTRING} geometries stored in a geometry list column? Defaults
#' to \code{TRUE}.
#'
#' @param compute_length Should the geographic length of the edges be stored in
#' a column named \code{length}? Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
#'
#' @return An object of class \code{\link{sfnetwork}}.

#' Convert an adjacency matrix into a neighbor list

#' Adjacency matrices of networks are n x n matrices with n being the number of
#' nodes, and element Aij holding a \code{TRUE} value if node i is adjacent to
#' node j, and a \code{FALSE} value otherwise. Neighbor lists are the sparse
#' version of these matrices, coming in the form of a list with one element per
#' node, holding the indices of the nodes it is adjacent to.

#' matrices are first converted into logical matrices using
#' \code{\link{as.logical}}.
